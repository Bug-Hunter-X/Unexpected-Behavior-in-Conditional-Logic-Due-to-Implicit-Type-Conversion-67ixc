This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion within conditional statements. The function `myFunction` aims to perform different calculations based on the input `x`, but it might produce incorrect results when `x` is precisely 10. The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.
